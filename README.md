# Touring

This is an example of a site that relies less on copy. Instead of a detail-heavy approach, the design focuses more on the picturesque views and various activities in action.

Once a visitor is drawn in by the photos, they can opt to click on the main call to action, “Plan Your Spring Trip” for more information.

From there, visitors can read about the various activities they can do in the city, then purchase any necessary tickets, passes, or equipment rentals.
